# Introduction
This is a Java Spring Boot repository that implements a RESTful API for a dating app. The API allows users to find nearby users based on their GPS location.

# Technical Test
As part of our technical interview process, we would like you to add a new feature to the API that allows users to find nearby users based on their age range. This feature is useful for users who are looking for matches within a specific age group.

To implement this feature, you will need to modify the existing codebase and add new functionality to the **‘/api/v1/{user_id}/crossings‘** endpoint. Specifically, you will need to add support for age range filtering using query parameters **‘min_age‘** and **‘max_age‘**.

We are interested in seeing how you approach this problem, and how you integrate your changes into the existing codebase. Good luck, and have fun!

# Getting Started
To get started with this repository, simply clone it to your local machine and run it using your preferred Java IDE or build tool.
